# Scalable-cloud-infrastructure-with-auto-scaling-R
In this project I focus on building a highly available and scalable cloud infrastructure using auto-scaling.

The goal is to design a solution that can automatically scale resources based on incoming traffic to ensure optimum performance without manual intervention. 

This is what I proceeded with. Main components: Web Applications: Simple web applications are deployed on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) running on an EC2 instance or equivalent virtual machine. 

Auto-scaling set: Configure the auto-scaling set to automatically adjust the number of instances based on CPU usage or other performance indicators. 

This ensures that the application can handle different loads efficiently. Load Balancer:

A load balancer is installed to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure even traffic distribution and high availability. Infrastructure as Code (optional): Using CloudFormation (AWS), Terraform, or an equivalent tool. 

It helps me automate the infrastructure setup. This ensures that replication can be easily handled programmatically. Why it's important: Auto-scaling is essential for modern cloud applications. 

This is because it ensures that the system can adapt to changes in traffic. Prevents over-allocation or under-allocation of resources. This setup ensures that the infrastructure is cost-effective and highly responsive. So any solutionâ€¦ 

-This is a basic skill for architects.
